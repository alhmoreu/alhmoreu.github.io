  Hi, I'm Ana and I started my journey into Data Science more than a year ago when I was convinced that this field would be the future of computer science and wanted to build my expertise on it.

  As a Data Scientist I have experience in object-oriented programming, agile development methodology Scrum and algorithm analysis in the telecommunications sector. 
  As an Industrial Engineer I have experience in research, planning and management in the energy sector. 

  “The world as we have created it is a process of our thinking. It cannot be changed without changing our thinking.”
  ― Albert Einstein

          There are 5 courses in this Deep Learning Specialization Course. In this Specialization, you built neural network architectures such as Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, LSTMs, Transformers, and learned how to make them better with strategies such as Dropout, BatchNorm, and Xavier/He initialization. You mastered these theoretical concepts, learned their industry applications using Python and <mark>TensorFlow</mark>, and tackled real-world cases such as autonomous driving, speech recognition, music synthesis, chatbots, machine translation, natural language processing, and more. You are now familiar with the capabilities and challenges of deep learning.
          - Neural Networks and Deep Learning
          - Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularization and Optimization
          - Structuring Machine Learning Projects
          - Convolutional Neural Networks
          - Sequence Models
